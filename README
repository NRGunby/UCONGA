OVERVIEW

UCONGA is a conformer ensemble generation and analysis tool developed at the
University of Canterbury by Nathaniel Gunby under the supervision of 
Dr. Sarah Masters and Dr. Deborah Crittenden. It is describe in a paper
submitted to J. Chem. Inf. Model. and currently under review.

It can generate conformer ensembles for all small molecules, regardless of
what elements or ring structure they contain. It can also analyse the generated
conformer ensemble looking for similarity either by clustering the torsion angles
or looking at the RMSD similarity between the conformers

REQUIREMENTS
UCONGA is written in python 2.7, and makes use of the numpy, scipy, and 
matplotlib libraries. Older versions of python 2 may work but have not been
tested. The input molecules must be in the cml file format, which can be
generated by the FOSS tools Avogadro (molecule builder) or OpenBabel 
(command-line format converter).

OTHER NOTES
Only the files UCONGA_generate, UCONGA_analyse, and UCONGA_align are for usage.
All other files are libraries used by them.
Usage instructions can be found in the USAGE file.
